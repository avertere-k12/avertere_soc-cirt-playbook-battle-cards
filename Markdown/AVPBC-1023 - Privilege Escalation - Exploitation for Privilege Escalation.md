2.  Create forensic backups of affected systems
3.  Perform endpoint/AV scans on affected systems
4.  Reset any compromised passwords
5.  Review the logs of all impacted assets
6.  Patch asset vulnerabilities

**(R) Recovery**

1.  Restore to the RPO within the RTO
2.  Assess and Address collateral damage
3.  Determine the root cause of the incident
4.  Resolve any related security incidents
5.  Restore affected systems to their last clean backup

**(L) Lessons/Opportunities**
