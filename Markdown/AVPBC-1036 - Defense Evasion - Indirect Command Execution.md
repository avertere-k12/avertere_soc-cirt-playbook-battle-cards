##### CIRT Playbook Battle Card: **AVPBC-1036 - Defense Evasion - Indirect Command Execution**

**(P) Preparation**

1.  Patch asset vulnerabilities
2.  Ensure antivirus/endpoint protection software is installed on workstations and laptops
3.  Confirm that servers and workstations are logging to a central location
4.  Review firewall, IDS, and IPS rules routinely and update based on the needs of the environment
5.  Restrict access to critical assets as needed
6.  Conduct employee security awareness training
7.  Restrict users to the least privileges required
8.  Audit system controls, features, and programs that may indirectly use the command line or a terminal and restrict such features to only those necessary \[1\]

**(I) Identification**

1.  Monitor for:  
    a. Social media activity for unusual body posts or inconsistent server requests  
    b. Suspicious emails and attachments coming into your organization
2.  Routinely check firewall, IDS, IPS, and SIEM logs for any unusual behavior
3.  Analyze web application metadata for suspicious user-agent strings and other artifacts
4.  Investigate and clear ALL alerts
5.  Monitor and analyze logs from host-based detection mechanisms, such as Sysmon, for events such as process creations that include or are resulting from parameters associated with invoking programs/commands/files and/or spawning child processes/network connections Social media activity related to your organization \[1\]

**(C) Containment**

1.  Inventory (enumerate & assess) environment technologies
2.  Detect | Deny | Disrupt | Degrade | Deceive | Destroy
3.  Observe -> Orient -> Decide -> Act
4.  Archive scanning related artifacts such as IP addresses, user agents, and requests
5.  Determine the source and pathway of the attack
6.  Issue a perimeter enforcement for known threatactor locations

**(E) Eradication**

1.  Close the attack vector by applying the Preparation steps listed above
2.  Perform endpoint/AV scans on targeted systems
3.  Reset any compromised passwords
4.  Inspect ALL assets and user activity for IOC consistent with the attack profile
5.  Inspect backups for IOC consistent with the attack profile PRIOR to system recovery
6.  Patch asset vulnerabilities

**(R) Recovery**

1.  Restore to the RPO within the RTO
2.  Address any collateral damage by assessing exposed technologies
3.  Resolve any related security incidents
4.  Restore affected systems to their last clean backup

**(L) Lessons/Opportunities**

1.  Perform routine cyber hygiene due diligence
2.  Engage external cybersecurity-as-a-service providers and response professionals
3.  Implement policy changes to reduce future risk
4.  Utilize newly obtained threat signatures
