##### CIRT Playbook Battle Card: **AVPBC-1033 - Credential Access - Input Capture**

**(P) Preparation**

1.  Patch asset vulnerabilities
2.  Perform routine inspections of controls/weapons
3.  Ensure antivirus/endpoint protection software is installed on workstations and laptops
4.  Conduct employee security awareness training
5.  Ensure all software is kept up to date
6.  Restrict users to the least privileges required
7.  Use application control to whitelist approved applications \[1\]
8.  Confirm that servers and workstations are logging to a central location

**(I) Identification**

1.  Monitor for:  
    a. Abnormal program execution  
    b. Malicious instances of Command and Scripting interpreters \[2\]  
    c. Calls to the SetWindowsHookEx and SetWinEventHook functions \[3\]  
    d. Rootkits  
    e. Unauthorized drivers and kernel modules
2.  Investigate and clear ALL alerts

**(C) Containment**

1.  Inventory (enumerate & assess)
2.  Detect | Deny | Disrupt | Degrade | Deceive | Destroy
3.  Observe -> Orient -> Decide -> Act
4.  Utilize EDR hunter/killer agents to terminate offending processes
5.  Remove the affected system from the network
6.  Determine the source and pathway of the attack
7.  Issue a perimeter enforcement for known threat actor locations

**(E) Eradication**

1.  Close the attack vector by applying the Preparation steps listed above
2.  Create forensic backups of affected systems
3.  Perform endpoint/AV scans on affected systems
4.  Reset any compromised passwords
5.  Inspect ALL assets and user activity for IOC consistent with the attack profile
6.  Inspect backups for IOC consistent with the attack profile PRIOR to system recovery
7.  Patch asset vulnerabilities

**(R) Recovery**

1.  Restore to the RPO within the RTO
2.  Assess and address collateral damage
3.  Resolve any related security incidents
4.  Restore affected systems to their last clean backup

**(L) Lessons/Opportunities**

1.  Perform routine cyber hygiene due diligence
2.  Engage external cybersecurity-as-a-service providers and response professionals
3.  Implement policy changes to reduce future risk
4.  Utilize newly obtained threat signatures
