##### CIRT Playbook Battle Card: **AVPBC-1057 - Defense Evasion - Valid Accounts**

**(P) Preparation**

1.  Patch asset vulnerabilities
2.  Perform routine inspections of controls/weapons
3.  Maintain Antivirus/EDR application updates
4.  Create network segmentation and log between segments
5.  Incorporate threat intelligence
6.  Perform routine inspections of asset backups
7.  Conduct user security awareness training (with a focus on suspicious MFA activity awareness) \[1\]
8.  Conduct response training (this PBC)
9.  Ensure applications are storing credentials in a secure manner and enforce credential updates at regular intervals \[1\]
10.  Immediately change default account credentials \[1\]
11.  Adhere to the principle of least privilege \[1\]
12.  Perform regular sweeps for inactive user accounts and verify they are purged from the environment \[1\]

**(I) Identification**

1.  Monitor for:  
    a. Abnormalities or potential abuse of existing user credentials \[2\]  
    b. Suspicious account behavior across systems that share accounts \[3\]  
    c. Newly created accounts gaining access to unauthorized systems or software \[3\]
2.  Investigate and clear ALL alerts associated with the impacted assets or accounts
3.  Routinely check firewall, IDS, IPS, and SIEM logs for any unusual activity

**(C) Containment**

1.  Inventory (enumerate & assess)
2.  Detect | Deny | Disrupt | Degrade | Deceive | Destroy
3.  Observe -> Orient -> Decide -> Act
4.  Issue perimeter enforcement for known threat actor locations
5.  Archive scanning related artifacts such as IP addresses, user agents, and requests
6.  Determine the source and pathway of the attack
7.  Fortify non-impacted critical assets

**(E) Eradication**

1.  Close the attack vector by applying the Preparation steps listed above
2.  Perform endpoint/AV scans on targeted systems
3.  Reset any compromised passwords
4.  Inspect ALL assets and user activity for IOC consistent with the attack profile
5.  Inspect backups for IOC consistent with the attack profile PRIOR to system recovery
6.  Patch asset vulnerabilities

**(R) Recovery**

1.  Restore to the RPO (Recovery Point Objective) within the RTO (Recovery Time Objective)
2.  Address any collateral damage by assessing exposed technologies
3.  Resolve any related security incidents
4.  Restore affected systems to their last clean backup

**(L) Lessons/Opportunities**

1.  Perform routine cyber hygiene due diligence
2.  Engage external cybersecurity-as-a-service providers and response professionals
3.  Implement policy changes to reduce future risk
4.  Utilize newly obtained threat signatures
5.  Avoid opening email and attachments from unfamiliar senders
6.  Remember that data and events should not be viewed in isolation but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities
