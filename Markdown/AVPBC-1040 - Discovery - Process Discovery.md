##### CIRT Playbook Battle Card: **AVPBC-1040 - Discovery - Process Discovery**

**(P) Preparation**

1.  Patch asset vulnerabilities
2.  Ensure antivirus/endpoint protection software is installed on workstations and laptops
3.  Confirm that servers and workstations are logging to a central location
4.  Review firewall, IDS, and IPS rules routinely and update based on the needs of the environment
5.  Restrict access to critical assets as needed
6.  Conduct employee security awareness training
7.  Restrict users to the least privileges required

**(I) Identification**

1.  Monitor for:  
    a. Malicious tasklist commands ran in Windows environment \[1\]  
    b. Malicious ps commands ran in Mac and Linux environments \[1\]  
    c. Actions that could be taken to gather system and network information \[1\]  
    d. Attempts by programs to exfiltrate process memory \[1\]
2.  Routinely check firewall, IDS, IPS, and SIEM logs for any unusual behavior
3.  Analyze web application metadata for suspicious user-agent strings and other artifacts
4.  Investigate and clear ALL alerts
5.  Investigate information provided by Windows Management Instrumentation and Windows API via PowerShell \[1\]

**(C) Containment**

1.  Inventory (enumerate & assess) environment technologies
2.  Detect | Deny | Disrupt | Degrade | Deceive | Destroy
3.  Observe -> Orient -> Decide -> Act
4.  Archive scanning related artifacts such as IP addresses, user agents, and requests
5.  Determine the source and pathway of the attack
6.  Issue a perimeter enforcement for known threat actor locations

**(E) Eradication**

1.  Close the attack vector by applying the Preparation steps listed above
2.  Perform endpoint/AV scans on targeted systems
3.  Reset any compromised passwords
4.  Inspect ALL assets and user activity for IOC consistent with the attack profile
5.  Inspect backups for IOC consistent with the attack profile PRIOR to system recovery
6.  Patch asset vulnerabilities

**(R) Recovery**

1.  Restore to the RPO within the RTO
2.  Address any collateral damage by assessing exposed technologies
3.  Resolve any related security incidents
4.  Restore affected systems to their last clean backup

**(L) Lessons/Opportunities**

1.  Perform routine cyber hygiene due diligence
2.  Engage external cybersecurity-as-a-service providers and response professionals
3.  Implement policy changes to reduce future risk
4.  Utilize newly obtained threat signatures
5.  Remember that data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities \[1\]
