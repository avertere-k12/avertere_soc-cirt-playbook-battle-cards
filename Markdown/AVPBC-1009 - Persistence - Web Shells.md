3.  Scan web servers for other instances of web shells
4.  Determine how the web shell was placed on the system
5.  Reset any potentially compromised passwords
6.  Review logs of any system the attacker may have accessed
7.  Scan affected systems with antivirus/endpoint software

**(R) Recovery**

1.  Restore to the RPO within the RTO
2.  Address collateral damage
