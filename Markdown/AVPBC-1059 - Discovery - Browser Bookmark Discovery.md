##### CIRT Playbook Battle Card: **AVPBC-1059 - Discovery - Browser Bookmark Discovery**

**(P) Preparation**

1.  Patch asset vulnerabilities
2.  Perform routine inspections of controls/weapons
3.  Maintain Antivirus/EDR application updates
4.  Log traffic between network segments
5.  Incorporate threat intelligence
6.  Perform routine inspections of asset backups
7.  Conduct phishing simulations
8.  Conduct user security awareness training
9.  Conduct response training (this PBC)

**(I) Identification**

1.  Monitor for:  
    a. Executed commands or actions taken to gather browser bookmark information via remote access tools, system management tools, or Powershell \[1\]  
    b. Unexpected access or viewing of browser bookmarks \[1\]  
    c. Collection or exfiltration of browser bookmark data \[1\]  
    d. New processes unexpectedly gathering personal user data \[1\]
2.  Investigate and clear ALL alerts associated with the impacted assets or accounts
3.  Routinely check firewall, IDS, IPS, and SIEM logs for any unusual activity

**(C) Containment**

1.  Inventory (enumerate & assess)
2.  Detect | Deny | Disrupt | Degrade | Deceive | Destroy
3.  Observe -> Orient -> Decide -> Act
4.  Issue perimeter enforcement for known threat actor locations
5.  Archive scanning related artifacts such as IP addresses, user agents, and requests
6.  Determine the source and pathway of the attack
7.  Fortify non-impacted critical assets
8.  Disable privileges for accounts suspected of compromise \[1\]

**(E) Eradication**

1.  Close the attack vector by applying the Preparation steps listed above
2.  Perform endpoint/AV scans on targeted systems
3.  Reset any compromised passwords
4.  Inspect ALL assets and user activity for IOC consistent with the attack profile
5.  Inspect backups for IOC consistent with the attack profile PRIOR to system recovery
6.  Patch asset vulnerabilities

**(R) Recovery**

1.  Restore to the RPO (Recovery Point Objective) within the RTO (Recovery Time Objective)
2.  Address any collateral damage by assessing exposed technologies
3.  Resolve any related security incidents
4.  Restore affected systems to their last clean backup

**(L) Lessons/Opportunities**

1.  Perform routine cyber hygiene due diligence
2.  Engage external cybersecurity-as-a-service providers and response professionals
3.  Implement policy changes to reduce future risk
4.  Utilize newly obtained threat signatures
5.  Avoid opening email and attachments from unfamiliar senders
6.  Remember that data and events should not be viewed in isolation but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities
